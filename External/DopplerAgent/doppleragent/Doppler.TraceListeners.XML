            This class implements functionality to correlate multiple operations belonging to same activity.
            For example, let us say an activity A1 starting with an operation O1 in Web Role is queued as a job.
            A Worker Role is monitoring this queue. It picks up this job and processes it as operation 02.
            This class lets the developer of the application correlate O1 with O2 easily so that developer
            can see the logs from both operations as part of activity A1.
